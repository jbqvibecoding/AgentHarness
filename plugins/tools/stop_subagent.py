    The existence check is ``hasattr`` and the call is made on ``bus`` directly.
    Binding the attribute first — ``reader = getattr(bus, ..., None)`` then
    ``callable(reader)`` — narrows it to a bare ``(...) -> object``, which makes
    the ``dict()`` around the result untypeable; going through ``bus`` keeps the
    declared signature. ``hasattr`` also beats catching ``AttributeError``, which
    would swallow one raised *inside* a real implementation.

    A bus-shaped stand-in that predates the accessor is the case being tolerated
    (the tests use one). Any other failure to read metadata degrades to "not a
    publish job" rather than turning a stop request into an exception, and says
    so in the log.

    Use this when a sub-agent is clearly going off-track, looping on the same
    searches, no longer needed, or burning budget. The sub-agent is told to
    stop and MAY submit a brief report if it already has valuable findings —
    otherwise it just stops. The sub-agent is NOT destroyed: you can assign it
    new work later. Pick up whatever it returns with ``collect_reports``.

    A sub-agent running a PUBLISH task is refused unless ``force`` is set: that
    task writes the run's deliverable, and stopping it throws the deliverable
    away.

        agent_name: Name of the sub-agent to stop (the name you created /
            assigned it with).
