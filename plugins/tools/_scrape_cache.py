# ── Positive scrape cache (cross-run, single-flight) ───────────────────────
#
# The negative cache above only suppresses re-hammering KNOWN-BAD URLs. This
# positive cache stores SUCCESSFUL scrape content so the same URL fetched by
# many sibling agents costs one Jina round-trip, not N.
#
# Why it pays: sibling agents researching one question converge on the same
# canonical pages, so unique URLs run far below total fetches (typically a
# 3-5x ratio on a fan-out run). Agents dispatched with asyncio.gather share
# one process and event loop, so a module-level singleton reaches all of them
# with zero plumbing.
#
# Scope = SCRAPE ONLY. The per-call SUMMARY_LLM extraction is deliberately NOT
# cached: sharing raw page bytes can't homogenise the runs' reasoning (same URL
# is the same content for everyone), but sharing extraction would leak one
# run's info_to_extract focus into another and couple the otherwise-independent
# trajectories. Successes only — a failed scrape is never stored, and a waiter
# whose leader failed/timed-out falls back to its own fetch, so the cache never
# converts one transient failure into a correlated N-run failure.

# Follower wait cap before falling back to an independent scrape. Bounds the
# "leader stalled → everyone blocks" failure mode.
_SINGLE_FLIGHT_TIMEOUT_S = 90.0
# Cap on distinct cached pages (FIFO eviction) — guards memory on long runs.
