"""recover_result — fetch back the part of a tool result the model never saw.

A tool result is cut in three places before it reaches the model, and the third
one throws its remainder away. ``ToolResultPostProcessor``
(``agent_harness/core/runtime/loop/tool_exec.py``, applied at
``agent_loop.py:762``) caps the message text at a much smaller bound than the
150 K sitting in front of it — 15 000 chars for sub-agents
(``workflows/agent_team/subagent_runtime.py:532``), 4 000 for bash — and unlike
the two earlier cuts it persists nothing and leaves no pointer, only a
``[... truncated N chars past M-char cap]`` marker.

The content is not actually gone. That cut applies only to the string handed to
``tool_msg(...)``; the ``ToolResult`` keeps the full body, and
``notify_tool_result`` has already recorded it, so the JSONL trajectory holds
what the model cannot see. This tool reads it back.

Two properties follow from *where* it runs, and both matter:

* **In-process.** It deliberately does not import ``plugins.tools._sandbox``.
  That import is the only thing that makes a tool sandboxed, and the trajectory
  is not mounted into any sandbox. Reading it on the harness's own filesystem
  needs no mount, no ``_path_auth`` prefix, and no write guards.
* **The model never names a path.** It passes an opaque ``(turn, call_id)``
  handle, so there is no path-traversal surface to defend — unlike the spill
  store, whose agent-visible paths cost eight guard sites.
