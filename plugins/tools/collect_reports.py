    """Collect reports from any sub-agents that have finished their tasks.

    Reports also drain automatically between turns when agents finish
    *during* a turn, but agents still running at the start of a new turn
    won't appear unless you call this. Block-wait here is the right move
    whenever you need a running agent's output to proceed.

    Behaviour:
      1. Non-blocking drain: any sub-agent that already finished returns
         its ``<report>`` immediately, regardless of ``timeout``.
      2. If the drain found nothing, classify the session state:
         * no agents at all → ``"create_subagent first"``.
         * agents created but never assigned → ``[status] no_work_queued``,
           call ``assign_task`` (do NOT poll again).
         * all submitted work already collected → ``[status] all_collected``,
           synthesize or assign a follow-up (do NOT poll again).
         * at least one session running → wait up to ``timeout`` seconds
           for the FIRST completion, then drain any others that
           completed during the wait.

    Reports come back as
    ``<report agent="NAME" status="complete|incomplete|failed|paused"
    reason="...">…</report>`` — treat ``incomplete`` / ``failed`` as
    partial evidence, not a final answer.

    Args:
        timeout: Max seconds to wait for the first completion when
                 something is genuinely running. Default 1800 (30 min).
                 Sub-agents on hard BrowseComp-style questions routinely
                 take 3-10 minutes — short timeouts are a poll, not a
                 wait. Pass a smaller value only when you specifically
                 want a cheap poll.

    Returns:
        One or more ``<report>`` blocks plus a status line. Status-only
        outcomes (nothing to wait for / timeout) come back as a single
        ``<report agent="orchestrator" …>`` block carrying the
        directive, followed by the ``[status]`` line.
