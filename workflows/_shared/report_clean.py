    Distinct from :func:`strip_document_fence_wrapper` above, which only

    single inline ``![alt](url)`` partway through the body in a
    ```` ```markdown ```` / ```` ```md ```` / bare ```` ``` ```` fence, which
    renders as literal text instead of an image.

    Fence detection is CommonMark-correct (built on the same
    :func:`_fence_marker` primitive as :func:`segment_lines`): backtick OR
    tilde, any run length >= 3, closer must be the same character and at
    least as long as the opener. A naive fixed-length regex mismatches a
    legitimate ```` ````markdown ```` (4-backtick) block and corrupts it
    instead of unwrapping it.

    Unwrapping is gated on citation discipline, not just the fence's content
    shape: every image URL inside a candidate block must exactly match
    either ``known_urls`` (the caller's ``canonical_references`` whitelist —
    pass this when available; it is independently built from the DAG, not
    from anything the writer typed) or a ``[N] Title. URL`` line the report
    cites elsewhere in its OWN text (:func:`extract_cited_urls` — the weaker
    fallback signal for when no whitelist was supplied). Every report_prompts
    variant already requires an embedded image's URL to be a cited source, so
    this is a self-consistency check, not a guess — and it is what stops a
    block from being unwrapped when the writer is demonstrating markdown
    syntax rather than citing a source (that example URL has no reason to
    also be a citation, so it stays fenced). A block with no matching
    citation is left untouched — the safe direction; this can only fail to
    unwrap a real image, never wrongly render a fake one.

    Only unwraps a block whose EVERY body line is, on its own, exactly one
