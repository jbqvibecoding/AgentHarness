# share it; both entry points fall back to :func:`detect_language` on any LLM failure.

# Cap the user question fed to the detector. The heuristic only needs a few
# hundred chars to gauge CJK density, but the LLM detector also has to see an
# explicit language request (e.g. "answer in English") — those tend to sit at
# the END of a longer current-turn message (pasted content first, instruction
# last), so this is a TAIL cap (see the slice below), not a prefix cap.
# Without a cap a 100k-char question would balloon every detector call; 8000
# (~2000 tokens) trades a still-negligible per-call cost for covering most
# real messages. An explicit request placed earlier than this many chars from
# the end of a single message is still missed.
