"""DuplicateQueryRollbackObserver — pop and re-run a turn that re-issues a search.

**Problem this fixes.** A research agent that has lost the result of an
earlier search (context compaction replaces older tool results with a
placeholder) commonly re-issues the *identical* query instead of
pivoting. Measured on a 200-question deep-research benchmark, the
losing trials averaged ~37 duplicate ``web_search`` queries each and ran
58-122 turns where a healthy trial finishes in ~22: the identical
results pile up in history, inflate the context, and steer the model
into a longer wandering loop. With ``sub_max_turns`` at 100 a sub-agent
can spend its whole allowance this way.

**What this observer does.** Fires on ``on_llm_response`` — after the LLM
emitted an assistant message with tool calls, *before* those tools run.
When a tracked tool call repeats a request already executed in this loop,
it returns an :class:`Intervention` that pops the assistant message and
re-runs the turn without consuming a ``max_turns`` slot (the loop's
``EXTRA_ATTEMPTS_BUFFER`` bounds total iterations). At the sampling
temperatures these profiles use, the next generation almost never
reproduces the same query verbatim.

**Rollback budget.** ``max_consecutive_rollbacks`` (default 5) is the
livelock valve: once 4 rollbacks have fired back-to-back the next
duplicate is allowed through. The counter resets only after a turn that
carried tracked tool calls and had no duplicate — a budget-exhaust
let-through deliberately leaves it at the ceiling, so the model has to
ride through one fully clean turn before detection re-arms.

**What is deduped.** Only search tools (``web_search`` by default).
``web_fetch`` on the same URL is often a legitimate retry after a
transient render failure, and ``bash`` / ``run_python_code`` arguments
are too varied to dedupe usefully.

**Key granularity — batch, not per-query.** ``web_search`` accepts a list
of queries, and the whole call is one dedup unit: ``[a, b]`` and
``[a, c]`` are different searches, so a model refining a batch
incrementally is never rolled back. Keying on individual queries instead
fires an order of magnitude more often and pops legitimate query
evolution.

**A turn holding a terminal tool is never popped.** The rollback discards
the whole assistant message, so every tool call in the batch dies with the
duplicate search. A batch of ``[web_search(dup), submit_report(...)]``
would lose the report permanently: the loop returns before
``_execute_tool_calls``, so ``FinalizeAnswerObserver`` never sees it. The
terminal set comes from the loop's own ``LoopPolicy`` rather than a
hardcoded list, plus a small floor for tools that finalize without being
the policy's terminal.

**A request is only remembered once it actually returned something.**
Bookkeeping happens in ``on_tool_result``, not when the turn is let
through. Search failures arrive as ordinary result *strings*
(``"[ERROR]: …"``, ``"No search results found."``) with ``is_error``
False, and a transient upstream failure is precisely the case where
re-running the same query is correct — the one case an eager recording
would block.
