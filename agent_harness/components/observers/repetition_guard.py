"""RepetitionGuard — hint when consecutive turns repeat the same tool call.

The generic counterpart to the two narrower guards:

* :class:`~agent_harness.components.observers.duplicate_query_rollback.DuplicateQueryRollbackObserver`
  knows what a *search* is: it dedupes ``web_search`` requests over the
  whole loop and pops the turn instead of hinting.
* :class:`~agent_harness.components.observers.text_repetition_guard.TextRepetitionGuard`
  compares assistant *prose* across turns, so it only sees a loop the
  model narrates.

This guard compares exact tool-call signatures on *consecutive* turns and
covers everything the other two do not — ``web_fetch`` on one dead URL,
the same ``bash`` command, the same ``read_file`` — where the repetition
is visible in the arguments and nowhere else.

``stop_after`` (opt-in, off by default) is what makes it a stop-loss rather
than a suggestion, and it exists because the other two guards cannot end
this particular loop:

* The duplicate-query rollback spends its ``max_consecutive_rollbacks``
  budget and then lets every further duplicate through, permanently, until
  a genuinely new request appears. On a model deterministic enough to
  reproduce a byte-identical tool call at temperature 0.7, that new request
  never comes.
* ``TextRepetitionGuard`` needs ~60 characters of near-identical *visible*
  text. Under ``thinking_format: tag`` the model's deliberation lands in
  ``thinking``, not ``ai_text``, so a turn that is "2900 characters of
  identical reasoning plus one tool call" leaves it nothing to compare and
  it never fires.

Which left nothing to terminate the pathology it was measured in: 71% of
sub-agents that exhausted their turn budget did so inside a run of ten or
more consecutive byte-identical calls, median 87, worst case 198 of 200.
Enable ``stop_after`` where stopping is affordable — a sub-agent whose
partial report still reaches fan-in — and leave it off for an agent that
IS the run.
