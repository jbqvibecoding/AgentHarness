    ``LLMFallbackChain([primary, fallback], default_triggers=("timeout","5xx"))``
    is the typical 2-tier setup. The chain's call surface is identical to
    a single :class:`LLMClient`: ``chat`` / ``stream`` delegate to whichever
    entry succeeds.

    Args:
        entries: ordered list of ``FallbackEntry``. The first entry is
            the primary; subsequent entries are tried in order on
            matching failure. Must be non-empty.
        default_triggers: applied to entries that don't carry an
            explicit ``triggers`` field. Default is ``("any_error",)``.

    Notes:
        - Streaming (``stream``) only fails over BEFORE the first chunk
          is yielded. Once the consumer has seen output we cannot rewind,
          so a mid-stream error propagates as-is. Token batching strategies
          (yield-once-complete) sidestep this; for true streaming
          robustness use a ``rate_limit`` / ``timeout`` trigger only and
          accept the mid-stream failure mode.

    No-op for duck-typed test stubs that don't implement the native
